# Identifying Housekeeping Genes in Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells
This repository contains the code used for the Final Degree Project (TFG) by Paula Vela Moreno at ESCI-UPF, conducted during an internship at the Bioinformatics Unit of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC).

## Project description
The aim of this project was to identify and validate stable housekeeping genes (HKGs) in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using bulk RNA-seq data. The selected HKGs were then used to improve differential gene expression analysis by correcting for unwanted variation using the RUVg method.
